Routes

As any user when browsing the app, I want to

<!-- click links/tabs that display different parts of the app.
see the route I am visiting in the url bar (i.e. Routines tab should have a route https://example.com/routines)
stay on the "same page", while seeing the content update (i.e. use React Router, no page refresh)
see Components/Tabs with corresponding routes:
